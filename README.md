# Bio API. 
This is an experimental repository to test different strategies on how to design the API for a biological library in different languages.
One of the purposes of this research is to make a flexible API that is universal throughout languages that follow different paradigms, such as Rust and Python.
One of the goals of this project is to develop a biological library in Rust that can be easily wrapped into a corresponding Python's package with the shared codebase (in Rust).
